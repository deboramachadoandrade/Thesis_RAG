In the research discussed, it mentions that the observation of compartmentalized diffusion of lipids, also known as lipid hopping, has been a topic of debate. The methods used in previous experiments, such as employing gold particles and quantum dots, are mentioned to be artifact-prone due to their size and difficulties in validating their interaction with the target molecule, potentially inducing oligomerization. These artifacts could have influenced the results and led to the absence of lipid hopping in your previous experiments with PE. Additionally, differences in experimental techniques and probes utilized can also impact the observation of lipid hopping.\"}}], \"child_spans\": null, \"span_kind\": \"LLM\"}"}, "_timestamp": 1709063375.5389194, "_runtime": 13.477484464645386, "_step": 1, "_wandb": {"runtime": 12}}

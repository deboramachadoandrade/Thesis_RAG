Specifically, the study demonstrated that the Arp2/3-branched actin networks significantly modulated the diffusion of DPPE in PtK2 cells, leading to different diffusion coefficients between untreated and CK-666-treated cells. This modulation of lipid diffusion by actin networks may explain why a previous experiment with phosphoethanolamine (PE) in PtK2 cells did not show any lipid hopping. The presence of factors like actin networks might restrict or modulate the mobility of certain lipids, potentially resulting in no apparent lipid hopping behavior observed in that specific experiment with PE.\"}}], \"child_spans\": null, \"span_kind\": \"LLM\"}"}, "_timestamp": 1709063958.2815533, "_runtime": 15.104243278503418, "_step": 1, "_wandb": {"runtime": 13}}

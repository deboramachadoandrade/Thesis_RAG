Based on the information provided in the text, one possible explanation could be the influence of the actin network in modulating lipid diffusion. The passage mentions that the lipid diffusion in PtK2 cells is affected by the Arp2/3-branched actin networks, with CK-666-treated cells showing significantly faster diffusion of DPPE (a phospholipid), as compared to untreated cells.\\n\\nTherefore, in your experiments with PE in PtK2 cells, it is possible that the absence of lipid hopping or compartmentalized diffusion was influenced by the specific characteristics of the lipid used (PE) and its interaction with the actin network in these cells. The modulation of lipid diffusion by cellular components like the actin network could potentially impact the observation of lipid hopping behavior. \\n\\nUltimately, the specific experimental conditions, the characteristics of the phosphoethanolamine lipid, and the cellular environment in PtK2 cells could have contributed to the lack of observed lipid hopping in your previous experiments. If you are looking for a more detailed explanation or further insights, additional experimentation or analysis may be needed to clarify the specific mechanisms at play in this context.\"}}], \"child_spans\": null, \"span_kind\": \"LLM\"}"}, "_timestamp": 1709063723.9319222, "_runtime": 15.425296306610107, "_step": 1, "_wandb": {"runtime": 14}}

In\\nthis classical problem, the expected duration of the game is analogous to the average\\ntransit time through the focal spot in FCS experiments. Analytical studies of spot-\\nvariation FCS in this background could shed light on potential further applications\\nof this method. In particular, the current spot-variation FCS analysis (based on the\\ndi\\ufb00usion law52) is analogous to the assessment of the expected duration of the game\\nonly. New insights could come from the assessment of the variance of the duration of\\nthe game, for example.\\nA pitfall in plasma membrane research is the premature attribution of pivotal func-\\ntions to observed e\\ufb00ects, which may delay further scienti\\ufb01c progress.
